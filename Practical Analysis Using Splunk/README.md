Commands that create statics and visualisation are called transforming commands. We can share theshare job log with other user it will remian active for 7 days, and every 10 min we need to refresh thelog search. We can dowload the report in csv,xml,json.

### 4.Exploring Events
If we search the objects in filters by default the event will turn the list, filtered keyword would behighlighted and we can examine the logs with timespan
